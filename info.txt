added login feature (access via ".../register" ".../login")
users don't work properly yet - redirects you to /home which doesn't exist but
  ".../users" is forbidden at the moment. Upon checking /routes/web.php, redirects
  correctly, so there is something wrong with views and/or Controllers
yet to add log in as admin feature
top dashboard needs fixing because one cannot really log out unless they know
  the necessary link. Mani interesē, kā sasaistīt layoutā
  css failu atpakaļ ar Bootstrap. Izskatās, ka tas pašreiz nobrucis.
